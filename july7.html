        <p class="lead text-muted">  Sadly it’s not as cool as I wanted it to be bc of time and that’s not an excuse but yeah.  I’m at work and it’s slow and I am just thinking about ya. Ur working rn too. I hope you like the gifts I get you. I’ll give you the reasoning behind each gift 
        <p>
          


 <ul>
    <li>The board with the things about 2000. I thought it was cool to see what was popular and what happened when you were born it has some info. It’ll be cool to look at when your older how you looked when you were 21 and also just look at the prices of things when you were born </li>
    <li>The shoes. I wanted to actually get you the baby blue air Jordan ones but I couldn’t find them only one this website but they didint have your size and they were super over priced at this other site. I am pretty sure those are you shoes you wear I remember scrolling through the adidas website until I found them bc I didint know what they were called lol </li>
    <li>The watch. Lol so I can be like “ don’t You have a watch” jk. But yeah it’s cool I like mine you can do a lot of stuff with it. Helps to track stuff like if you work out and you can do it with sleep too. I can send you like heartbeats and yeah I hope you like it I think I choose prolly not a good color  though
    So Yeah if you want to change it to a different color lmk :)  </li>
    <li> the other gifts like the shirt bc it had 2000 on it lol and the book bc it was my fav book when i was in highschool. The perfume i saw it online and it had good reviews so i got it on amazon. and the (; gift bc 
        i think you would look goood with it and its your fav color. cant wait for you to wear it (; 
    </li>
  </ul>
