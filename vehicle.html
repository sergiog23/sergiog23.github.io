					<p>Vehicle Recommender App</p>
    
					<ul>
					  <li>Search a variety of vehicles on the american market</li>
					  <li>Allows you to choose from attributes ranging from MSRP to Horspower</li>
					  <li>Returns you a list of the top cars based on your answers</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Why will someone need this App?</p>
					
					<p2>Anyone who is in search of a vehicle can quickly and efficiently get the best options tailored to them. With this app, you are able to answer a few short questions and then get returned a list of cars in the american market. There are certainly other apps like Carmax,truecar.com, and Kelleys Blue book but those are biased and often list the cars they have. The dataset that I am pulling from has over 32,000 cars and it has many attributes that can show the differences between the choices. This app will make it easy for anyone to search for a vehicle. </p2>
					<br>
					<p2> The first Feature will allow a person to search for a car in the Dataset. </p2>
					<br>
					<p2> The second feature will allow the classifer to target attributes and return the best car according to the persons answers</p3>
					<br>
					<p2> The third feature will allow the system to caption the image with a vehicle in it.</p2>
