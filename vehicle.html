					<p>Youtube Video Search app </p>
    
					
					<p>Why will someone need this App?</p>
					 
					<p2> Anyone who is in search of a video can quickly and efficiently get the best options tailored to them. With this app, you are able to search with a query and get the best results back. There are certainly other apps like youtube,vimeo, and twitch but they do not perform well if you search for example ‘Funny’ they return videos that have funny in the title. The dataset that I am pulling from shows data on youtube videos and it has many attributes that can show the differences between the choices. This app will make it easy for anyone to search for a video. </p2>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p2> The first Feature will allow a person to search for a video in the Dataset. </p2>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p2> The second feature will allow the classifer to target attributes and return a list with a percentage on each video that matches the search </p3>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p2> The third feature will allow the system to caption the image uploaded.</p2>
