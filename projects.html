					<p>Vehicle Recommender App</p>
    
					<ul>
					  <li>Search all the current cars on the American market</li>
					  <li>Allows you to choose from attributes ranging from MSRP to Horspower</li>
					  <li>Returns you a list of the top cars based on your answers</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Why will someone need this App></p>
					<p2>Anyone who is in search of a vehicle can quickly and efficiently get the best options tailored to them. With this app, you are able to answer a few short questions and then get returned a list of cars in the american market. There are certainly other apps like Carmax but those are biased and often list the cars they have. The dataset that I am pulling from has over 32,000 cars and it has many attributes that can show the differences between the choices. This app will make it easy for anyone to search for a vehicle. </p2>
