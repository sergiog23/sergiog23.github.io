        <p class="lead text-muted"> So it is december now we are all done with school for now, I had planned to keep
            updating this sooner just didint have that much time, but i assure you as time goes on this site will grow (:  </p>
  
        <p>
          <p> 
              SO I had this idea of like randomly writing down my thoughts about you in my notes app and then transfering them on to here whenever
            I had a bunch but so far i only have a couple entries lol ( not that good ). In my mind I want this to be a more interactive site
            like you should be able to make changes too, obv that would mean i would need to work on the functionality and allow you to make changes
            thats a 2022 goal lol, we can write down like idk books weve written, places we gone or wanna go or just anything really. maybe even do like blog posts
            create memories. sounds cool right. i was thinking like creating a time capsule like virtually create something here together like write it down and then like 
            how many ever years later we will get like a notif or something that we know its time to open, and yeah, I also want to do like the podcast I was telling you 
            and store it on here or atleast the link to it and its one that it is unscripted but we both prepare questions for each other so yeah that should happen sometime 
            in 2022. and pictures I think we do take pics but i think not enough sometimes lol so hopefully we get a lot this year coming up. THis can also be a space 
            where we can write down our goals as a couple .  
         </p>
         <p> 
            I know thats a lot but thats the ideas that I had, maybe all of them wont get done due to life and stuff but hopefully some doo.

       </p>

        entry 3/8/2022 @ 6:58PM  
        Yeah i included the time too haha cause i am extra like that, I wonder if you go back and read these every once in a while to check If i have updated, 
        i am sorry i have not been able to update this too much, school has been keeping me busy lately. I still plan to develop and write here more often, not gonna lie the code has been getting 
        messy so might have to rewrite some of this website. I will try to make it more interactive so that youll be able to edit too. 
        . My prof is late for class and I am just on computer.
