				<p>vi. Challenges Faced </p>
				<p2> Some of the challenges I faced when developing Phase I of the project was on how to connect Python and HTML. I needed to figure out how the user entered search and process the input given by the user and run that input against the Tf-IDf algorithm and give them a score and return the top searches.</p2>
				<p2> I also ran into issues hosting the project on pythonanywhere. </p2>
				<p2> Also, I had an issue when I created the weight vector I was getting erroneous results.</p2>
				<p>viii. Blog Article</p>
				<p2> During the development phase of the first part of this project I initially began to put my data and tokenize the textual components of it. Then I stored the data in a list and computed the TF of each word, then I computed the IDF score of each work. I then had a sum of the TF-IDF score and stored that. When  the user enters a query I tokenize the input and compute the TF-IDF scores against the data set I have. I return the top 5 searches if available.</p2>
				<p>ix. Basic algorithms</p>
				<p2> The Algorithms I mainly used were TF and IDF</p2>
				<p2> TF is term frequency and it is calculated calculating the number of the times the term occured in the document</p2>
				<p2> IDF measures how important a term is, in this process we weigh the terms and scale up the rare ones. I also used nltk.stopwords to remove frequent words like 'the' 'a' 'in' </p2>	
				<p2> I also included the removal of stopwords using nltk, to filter out common stopwords and produce a better TF-IDF calculation </p2>
